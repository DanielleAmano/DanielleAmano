<h3>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h3>
<p>Hi, <b>I'm Danielle</b>,<br>
a passionate and dedicated QA Tester with experience in manual testing, combined with a fresh skill set in test automation. <br>
Recently, I completed an automation course, where I gained proficiency in using Java, Selenium, and Eclipse to design and implement automated test scripts.<br>
  This has expanded my ability to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of testing processes while contributing to faster release cycles.<br> </p>
I'm eager to apply both my manual and automation testing skills to deliver high-quality software solutions. <br>
With a strong attention to detail and a passion for continuous learning, I am excited to be part of a team that strives for excellence in software quality.
